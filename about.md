I work as ML Architect at EY. I was born and brought up in Mumbai, India, and currently working in Bangalore. I have more than 10 years of experience working in IT MNCs. I am a hands-on developer but also enjoy interacting with clients to understand their pain points and design and build easy-to-use solutions for them.</span></p>

When I am not working I could be spending time :
<ul>
  <li>Reading mystery novels</li>
  <li>Watching Netflix</li>
  <li>Scrolling through my youtube feed</li>
  <li>Cooking</li>
  <li>Learning French</li>
</ul>
