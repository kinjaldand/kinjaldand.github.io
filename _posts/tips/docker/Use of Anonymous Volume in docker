docker run –v /app/data …
docker run –v data:/app/data …
docker run –v /path/to/code:/app/code …

Use of Anonymous Volume in docker  
-  When using bind mount, everything in host will get copied on container. This will also override folders like "node_modules" or "logs" or ".venv". Even if those are in dockerignore.
-  To prevent override, we can create volumes for subdirectories. Since in docker, more specific path will take precendence over more general path.
-  Hence, if bind mount for "backend", then we can create named_volume for "/backend/logs" and anonymous volume for "/backend/node_modules".
-  This way they will stay independent of the "bind mount" and wont get overridden.
